# Happy New Years! 

I celebrate every New Years Eve the same way and I wouldn't have it any other way. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/56779509-2ba3-4f52-b648-18a37aa00d1e.jpg)

It starts off with a New Years Eve dinner with the family, followed by a food induced nap, and finally the ball drop. 

A lot of people associate a new year with new habits, but I've always had the philosophy that a new page turns sometime between the point of when you knock out at the end of the night and when you wake up in the morning. The first few thoughts that rush through your mind that morning end up dictating the potential for that day. That's why I never look at my phone when I wake up. I take a deep breathe, reflect, clap my hands and get started. Reminds me of the good ol' [Dicky Fox][0]. 
> 
> I love getting up in the morning; clap my hands and say, 
> 
> This is going to be a GREAT DAY!

And if it wasn't Dicky Fox has [more][1] to share!

> Roll with the punches; tomorrow is another day. 

That's it for now. Time for NYE leftovers

HNY from my family to yours!
