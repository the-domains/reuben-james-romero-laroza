# Happy New Years! 

I celebrate every New Years Eve is the same, and I wouldn't have it any other way. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/56779509-2ba3-4f52-b648-18a37aa00d1e.jpg)

New Years Eve dinner with the family, followed by a food induced nap, and finally the ball drop. 

Heres to 2016!
