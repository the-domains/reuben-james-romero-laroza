# Shooting around Signal Hill, CA

My study buddy, DN, took me and another buddy out a couple nights ago. We started off with sushi and some drinks, then went shopping for a bit. At the end of the night we went to Signal Hill. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f6ea9cfd-59c1-4e5e-82df-61447f3d4a71.png)

I've been there once before, but not to the Hilltop Park. It was just as stunning, if not more than before. You get to the top, look around and you forget why you were there in the first place. It would be a damn shame if my first instinct would be to whip out the camera and start snapping. Views like these need the respect they reserve. After standing there for about 10 minutes and realizing my toes were about to freeze off, I set up the tripod and starts shooting away. Here are my favorites from that night: ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/622bcd15-4375-4bf6-ac94-a013c8d17f2b.jpg)

It's always fun shooting @ night. I currently have a remote shutting coming in the mail. Expect more night photography to come!
